Go into the standard C or POSIX locale:
$ export LC_ALL='C'
check the results
$ locale
Output:
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="C"
LC_NUMERIC="C"
LC_TIME="C"
LC_COLLATE="C"
LC_MONETARY="C"
LC_MESSAGES="C"
LC_PAPER="C"
LC_NAME="C"
LC_ADDRESS="C"
LC_TELEPHONE="C"
LC_MEASUREMENT="C"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="C"
LC_ALL=C

It works.

Then I created the sorted file named "words" in my working directory.
$ sort /usr/share/dict/words > words

Then I created the text file containing the HTML in this assignment's web page.
$ wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/cs35L/assign/assign2.html

Run the commands with the HTML assign2.html file being standard input:
(In order to observe the output, I put the output into a file named test.txt)

Before running the commands, I firstly read the man page of tr.
I know that -c means complement and -s means squeeze-repeats.

$ tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html > test.txt

This command change all the characters other than 'A-Za-z' into a newline.
Notice that the space before the public is TAB, which counts as one character.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

$ tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html >test.txt

This command squeeze the mutiple new lines into just one new lines.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Before running the command, I read the man page of sort, which sort lines of 
text files.

$ tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'< assign2.html | sort

sort lines of the output files generated from last command.
It looks like

a
a
.
.
.
.
a
A
A
.
.
A
able
about
.
.
.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Before running the command, I read the man page of sort, I knew -u means unique

$ tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'< assign2.html | sort -u

remove the repeated lines in the last sorted file.
It looks like:

a
A
able
about
.
.
.

With a single 'a' instead of multiple 'a'.
' 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Before running the command, I read the man page of comm, which compares sorted
files FILE1 and FILE 2 line by line.

with no options, produce three-column output. Column one contains lines unique
to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains
lines common to both files.

$ tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u < assign2.html | comm - words

The output has three column. Column 1 contains lines unique to sorted 
assign2.html and column 2 contains lines unique to words file. Column 3 
contains lines common to both files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

$ tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | comm -23 - words 

option "-23" means suppress column 2 and 3.

The output only has column 1 which contains lines unique to sorted assign2.html

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using wget to obtain the copy of the Hawaiian web page

$ wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm

Look what do the contents look like

$ emacs hwnwdseng.htm

-----------------------------------------------------

Check the misspelled Hawaiian words:

$ cat assign2.html | tr -cs "pk'mnwlhaeiou" '[\n*]' | 
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| sort -u | comm -23 - hwords > misHawaiian

$ wc -w misHawaiian
Output:
204 misHawaiian

Thus, there are 204 misspelling of Hawaiian words.

Check the misspelled English words:

$ cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | 
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words > misEnglish

$ wc -w misEnglish
Output:
38 misEnglish

Thus, there are 38 misspelling of Hawaiian.
