I don't konw why there is Reversed ...
I checked Piazza and did not find any valuable answers for it.

I cheked Piazza the other day and find a student's answer:

Use git checkout v3.0 to move the head to version you're currently on

Then I tried:

$ git checkout v3.0

Output:

Note: checking out 'v3.0'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 022cd5c... version 3.0


Then I tried to install patches again:
$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

Output:

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

Now, it works.
