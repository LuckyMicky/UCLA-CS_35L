1. Set up BeagleBone

I used the my own Mac to connect with the BeagleBone board.


2. Find BEAGLEBONE as an external storage device and open it.

3. Double-click on the "START.htm" file.
This will open a webpage located on the BeagleBone to show you how to setup your
board step-by-step.It will highlight the completed steps as green.

At first, only the step "Plug in BeagleBone via USB" already highlighted as green.

4. Install the two drivers for Mac and restart.

After restarting my Mac, the second step is still red.
And then I searched the piazza to find the reason.
REASON:
"Versions of Mac OS X 10.11 and newer have a rewritten USB stack that is
substantially less compatible than that in 10.10 and below. Unfortunately, Apple
have not published any documentation for the new-style USB interfaces exposed in
10.11, so HoRNDIS can only use the USB APIs available in 10.10 and below, which
have been broken in newer versions of OS X. As such, newer versions of OS X may
have difficulty connecting to certain devices."

SOLUTION:

Download the patch from
http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnyus.joshuawise.com%2FHoRNDIS-rel8pre2-dbg.pkg%3AnWVXptevoA9QSEAQQXuPQfiJ240&cuid=1845838

Applying the patch file and restart

Now the second step is green.


5. SSH into my BeagleBone.

Opem my terminal:

sudo ssh -Y root@192.168.7.2

Note: the -Y option is very important for this lab. Since without -Y, we can not excute the applications like firefox.

6. Connect BeagleBone to wifi.

a. Start the connmanctl terminal:

root@beaglebone:~# sudo connmanctl

b. Turn on the wifi for your BeagleBone:

connmanctl> enable wifi

Output:

Error wifi: Already enabled

c. Scan all available wifi access points:

connmanctl> scan wifi

Output:

Scan completed for wifi

d. List all the discovered access points:

connmanctl> services


Output is a list of access point which have the following format:

*AO CR3760-wifi          wifi_2cf7f10669f8_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk
    CSD                  wifi_2cf7f10669f8_435344_managed_none
    CSD-Auth             wifi_2cf7f10669f8_4353442d41757468_managed_none
    CSD-Guest            wifi_2cf7f10669f8_4353442d4775657374_managed_none
    BeagleBone051129     wifi_2cf7f10669f8_426561676c65426f6e65303531313239_managed_none
    eduroam              wifi_2cf7f10669f8_656475726f616d_managed_ieee8021x
    UCLA_WIFI            wifi_2cf7f10669f8_55434c415f57494649_managed_none
    UCLA_WEB             wifi_2cf7f10669f8_55434c415f574542_managed_none
e. Register as the prospective client:

connmanctl> agent on

Output:

Agent registered

f. Connect to the wifi provided in the Boelter 3760 classroom

connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f10669f8_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk

Output:

connected

g. close the the application connmanctl:

connmanctl> quit

7. Update the database of apt-get:

root@beaglebone:~# sudo apt-get update

8. Install xauth tool for X11 forwarding support for future SSH connections to your BeagleBone:

root@beaglebone:~# sudo apt-get install xauth

9. Install Firefox on your BeagleBone:

root@beaglebone:~# apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

10. Try to open firefox on my own Mac first:

root@beaglebone:~# firefox

It opened the firefox after outputing a few errors and waiting for about 30 seconds.

11. Now I am going to do the Client Step with my Partner Changyu Yan, who opearated a server.

a. Generate public and private keys

root@beaglebone:~# ssh-keygen

Output:

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/root/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
b1:d0:8b:d5:60:1e:b0:29:42:ca:0a:2f:99:d7:38:8f root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|  .   ..+        |
|.o     * +       |
|o.. . + = .      |
|o+ + . + +       |
|= = . . S        |
| o +             |
|  E .            |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+

b. Check the ip address (Only for the server), but I, as a client, also did it:

root@beaglebone:~# ifconfig


Output:

Note:
The IP address is located under the network interface "wlan0" and labeled as "inet addr"
For example, my IP address is 172.31.117.75

My partner's IP address is 10.97.85.224

c. Copy my public key to the server for key-based authentication

root@beaglebone:~# ssh-copy-id -i daxuan@10.97.85.224

Output:

The authenticity of host '10.97.85.224 (10.97.85.224)' can't be established.

Debian GNU/Linux 8

BeagleBoard.org Debian Image 2016-06-14

Support/FAQ: http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian

default username:password is [debian:temppwd]

daxuan@10.97.85.224's password:

Then I input my password: 1234, which set in my partner's Mac(Server)

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'daxuan@10.97.85.224'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

d. Add private key to authentication agent (ssh-agent)

$ ssh-add

e. SSH to server:

root@beaglebone:~# ssh -Y daxuan@10.97.85.224

Output:
Debian GNU/Linux 8

BeagleBoard.org Debian Image 2016-06-14

Support/FAQ: http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian

default username:password is [debian:temppwd]

Enter passphrase for key '/root/.ssh/id_rsa':

(Then I enter the passphrase for key I set on my own laptop)

Note: the "-Y" option is crutial here. Without it, it will not work for openning firefox on my server.

12. Now I am going tp try to run a command on the remote host

$ firefox

Output:

firefox-esr:5327): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_ref: assertion 'object->ref_count > 0' failed

(firefox-esr:5327): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_unref: assertion 'object->ref_count > 0' failed

[Child 5373] ###!!! ABORT: Aborting on channel error.: file /build/firefox-esr-UpRacR/firefox-esr-52.5.0esr/ipc/glue/MessageChannel.cpp, line 2152

Then, after waiting for about 30 seconds, I can see the firefox is opened on my Laptop. It works!

Note: If not using -Y option to either SSH the BeagleBoard or the server, it will output:
Error: GDK_BACKEND does not match available displays.
