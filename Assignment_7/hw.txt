According to the public-key cryptosystem, the resulting network is still secure.
Sicne other teams have not the private key and they can not enter our host and
decrypt any message.
Meanwhile, it is computationally infeasible to find out the private key
given the public key. Thus, the network is secure.

(1) Althoufh the other teams had also tapped on our keyboards and had all the
keystrokes, the network is still secure. Since they can not find out what our
private key is even though we share the same passphrass. The generated private
key is going to be different.

(2) Depends. If the private key is stored in the USB, them it is not sercure.
Otherwise, it is secure.

Since “gpg --verify” can only compare the cleartext signature decrypted by
using a public key. The problem will occur when someone stealthy substitute
the original owner's public key to his own public key. Therefore, in this way,
we can not verify if the file is personally created by its real owner.
A solution to such a proble which is widely used nowadays is to trust in well
organized third party company/organization that keeps a track of the origin
point of the file with its author. As loog as we trust in this third party
organization, the verification will always be correct.
