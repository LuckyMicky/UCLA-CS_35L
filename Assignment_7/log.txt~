1. Set up Ubuntu

I used the lab computer and entered the BIOS to change the boot sequence.
Then, I enter "try Ubuntu" to run it from the DVD.

2. Make sure I have openssh-server and openssh-client installed

$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

3. Find out it has not installed and to install them

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client

In this lab, I am the server and my partner Changyu is client.
4. Generate public and private keys and using default setting.

$ ssh-keygen

5. Create an account for the client on the server

$ sudo useradd -d /home/daxuan -m daxuan
$ sudo passwd daxuan

6. After setting the password, I create .ssh directory for new user

$ cd /home/daxuan
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

7. Change ownership and permission on .ssh directory

$ sudo chown -R username.ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

8. Disable password-based authentication

$ emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

In the emacs editor, I changed PasswordAuthentication option to no

9. To get my IP address, I typed 

$ ifconfig

and my IP address is 10.97.85.96
------------------------------------------------------------------
The follwing steps are my partner Changyu(Client) 

1. Generater public and private keys

$ ssh-keygen

2. Copy her public key to the serever for key-based authentication

ssh-copy-id -i daxuan@10.97.85.96

3. Add private key to authentication agent(ssh-agent)

$ ssh-add

4. SSH to server

$ ssh -X daxuan@10.97.85.96

5. She then run a command on the remote host

$ firefox

and she can see the firefox is opened on his lab computer.
