1.Grab Coreutils 7.6
$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2.Extract the .tar.gz file 
$ tar xvzf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

3.Go into the folder created
$ cd coreutils-7.6/

4.Read the Install file
$ emacs Install

 I know that --prefix flag allows me to install to a specific folder rather 
than the default /usr/bin

5. Configue the code and make it installed to my required directory

I first created a directory called coreutilsInstall in my home directory ~
$ cd ~
$ mkdir coreutilsInstall
Then I got the current path by using pwd
$ pwd
Output:
/u/ee/ugrad/daxuan/coreutilsInstall


Then I run the configure command in my coreutils-7.6/ folder 

$ ./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/daxuan/coreutilsInstall

6. compile the program (also inside coreutils-7.6/ folder)

$ make
$ make install

7. set the locale parameter LC_ALL to the problmatic en_US.UTF-8

$ export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

8. Check the bug inside the new created ls command

First, go into the coreutilsInstall directoy that I created under the home 
directory.

$ cd ~/coreutilsInstall

I want to have a look at what I just created after I run the configure, make 
and make install commands

$ ls

Output:
bin  lib  share

Thus there are 3 directories inside the coreutilsInstall directory. The new
installed ls command should be inside the bin directory.

Then, go to the bin folder and check the problematic ls command
$ cd bin
$ ./ls -l /bin/bash

Output:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 2017-08-03 06:36 /bin/bash

I can see the output format is YYYY-MM-DD instead of the traditional Unix date.

Note: To call the "buggy" ls command inside the directory, use ./ls instead of 
ls. If I use the default ls command in my /usr/bin directory

$ ls -l /bin/bash
Output :
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 Aug  3 06:36 /bin/bash
 
9. Create the patch file
Go to coreutils-7.6/ directory and create the patch file called patch.diff

$ vim patch.diff

and then copied and pasted Brady's patch into it.

Note: using vim instead of emacs for the patch file because emacs might perform
unnomally by coping the codes from the browser.

Noted that Brady's patch code begin with 

diff --git a/src/ls.c b/src/ls.c
index 1bb6873..4531b94 100644
--- a/src/ls.c
+++ b/src/ls.c

since our ls.c source file is located at ./src/ls.c Thus I want to discard the
first / 
That is to say I do not want a/ or b/ 
After reading the man page of patch, I found that the option -pnum strip the 
smallest prefix containing num leading slashes from each file name found in the
patch file. 
Therefore, I will use -p1 option to locate my ls.c file at path ./src/ls.c

10. Apply the patch
In /coreutils-7.6/ directory, I call the command:
$ patch -p1 < patch.diff

Output:
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 2013 (offset -1 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 2028 (offset -1 lines).

Thus, I patched successfully.
I aslo checked the file. It had been changed.

11. Recompile the program

We do not need configure again since there was a "Makefile" when I first called
configure and the the dependency between packages did not change.
The details about the machine(lnxsrv) also remained the same.

In the same directory (coreutils-7.6)
Use make to rebuild the patched ls.c

$ make

We need to make again because the program code had been changed.

we do not need to call "make install" because we want to compare the modified
ls.c with the ls.c installed in the ~/coreutilsInstall. We do not want to 
overwrite it.

12. Make sure the change fixes the bug

Go into the /coreutils-7.6/src because we just patched the ls.c file in this 
directory. Then 

$ ./ls -l /bin/bash 

Output:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 Aug  3 06:36 /bin/bash

It successfully fixes the bug.

Then, go to the installed ls directory

$ cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin/

$ ./ls -l /bin/bash
Output:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 2017-08-03 06:36 /bin/bash

Thus, the installed ls doesn't work.

13. Test on a file that has been recently modified

For a recently modified file:

a. Unmodified version
$ ~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l coreutils-7.6.tar.g
-rw-r--r-- 1 daxuan eeugrad 10014650 2017-10-16 14:31 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

b. Fixed version
$ ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 daxuan eeugrad 10014650 Oct 16 14:31 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

For an at least a year-old file:

I touched the coreutils-7.6.tar.gz file:

$ touch -t 9511290000 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

a. Unmodified version
$ ~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 daxuan eeugrad 10014650 1995-11-29 00:00 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

b. Fixed version
$ ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
-rw-r--r-- 1 daxuan eeugrad 10014650 Nov 29  1995 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

All done :)
