The real time is close to user time divide by number of threads.

There was a slightly increase for user time due to the cost of creating more threads.

When allpying the 8 threads, we can see that it is much more faster than the 1-thread version.

This shows the power of parallelism.

3. Issues previously ran into
when using -lpthread, I saw there were errors like no reference for error pointer. After fixing the code in main.c, it works now.
