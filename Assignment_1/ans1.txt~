Ans:
There are 271 symbolic links in the same directory as find.

Explanation:
I firstly found the directory of find. Then after lokking the man page of the f
ind command and searching the word "symbolic" in the man page to get the proper
options. Then use the option I had found to output all symbolic links into a fi
le I had created. Finally, use the command "wc" to count the number of symbolic links.

Explanation Command:
$ which find
Output: /usr/bin/find
$ man find
$ find /usr/bin/ -type l > temp.txt
$ man wc
$ wc -l temp.txt
Output: 271 temp.txt

Thus, there are 271 lines in temp.txt and this means there are 271 symbolic lin
ks in the same directory as find.
